# Orion Portfolio Starter - Meteor | BUREAU WEHRMANN

##Work in Progress

*This is a personal project aiming to create a new platform based on a fork of iamkevingreen/Orion-Starter*

At this point the code is highly individual, I will strip and abstract it once everything is running well, hopefully giving back to the meteor community.
